# polygon-test

Quick test to experiment with different polygon tessellation strategies.

The drawing controls are a bit awkward:
- Left mouse button adds a new vertex.
- Right mouse button removes previously added vertex.
- Space resets polygon.
- ESC exits polygon drawing mode and saves current polygon.
- '=' and '-' cycle rendering modes.
